# Purpose of algorithm
The purpose of this algorithm is to allow the user, to change elements within a list.  
Search if an element exists within a list, and a list within a list. As well as,  
being able to search for the value of an element behind a key for a dictionary.  
Furthermore, having the ability to replace the value with something of use.  

# A few features:
1. Able to search, and replace elements within a list. Even if the list is two layers deep. Meaning it has a list inside a list. While searching there will be return values. If you have a two layered list, it will return two values index1 and index2. Which will get you to that element, for you to replace it or change it.

2. Able to do the same to a dictionary of lists. And will also let you replace the value of the list, as the key and the index will be the return values for you to use.

# Features to be added: 
1. Type casting an entire list to a specific data type. ie. Strings to integers. This option will be implemented where available.  
You don't expect to be able to cast a string into an integer, that doesn't make sense.
